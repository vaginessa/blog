--------------
I've made two small improvement to my "15minutes":/software/15minutes/ app for mac (which is meant as a simple productivity tool that helps to focus on doing things).

Improvements:

* time display is bigger
* it now has non-awful icon

I also came to a realization that it should really be more unobtrusive app that lives in the menu bar and has even more minimal UI. However, at present I don't have the time to do that. 15minutes has been something that I wanted to get done as quickly as possible. It would be ironic if my productivity dropped due to spending a lot of time working on productivity-enhancing application.
