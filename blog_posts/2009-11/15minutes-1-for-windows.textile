I've made a small update to "15minutes":/software/15minutes/ for windows to fix few small things that were never the less annoying in frequent usage.

First, when the timer finishes, the window no longer steals focus from whatever it is you're doing.

Second, the window is smaller - important when running on lower resolution screens.

And finally, when the timer is running, it gets slightly different background color so that it's easy to tell if timer is running or not (I would sometimes forget to start the timer).

And here's how it looks like:
