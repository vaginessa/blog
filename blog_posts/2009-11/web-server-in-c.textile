--------------
If you need a simple web server for .NET, "this":http://www.codeplex.com/webserver is a solid piece of software.

I've needed an internal web server for my C# application and re-using someone else's code certainly beats writing it from scratch.

It's not spelled out on the web page, but it comes in two flavors:

* lite, with only http serving core. When you download the code, look for it in branches directory
* standard, which includes additional capabilities like templating engine

When I added it to my project, I didn't know about the lite version, so I manually added the files to the project and removed files I didn't need. If I were starting from scratch, I would just use the lite version.

So far I'm happy with the code - it does exactly what it advertises and saved me a bunch of time I didn't spend writing web server code.

It's distributed under Apache 2.0 license so can be used in commercial software as well.
