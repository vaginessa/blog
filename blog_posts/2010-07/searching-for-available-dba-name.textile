Before you register a "DBA":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doing_business_as name (i.e. Doing Business As, also known as Fictitious Business Name), you need to make sure that a given name is available. For a San Francisco business, you can do an on-line search of existing names "here":http://www.criis.com/sanfrancisco/sfictitious.shtml. If the name you chose is not on that list, you're good to go.

As a side-note: registering DBA in California requires posting a notice in the newspaper. First, it's oddly antiquated in a state that is home to Silicon Valley. Second, what will happen after the inevitable downfall of paper editions of newspapers?
