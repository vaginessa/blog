Title: Exporting data from EverNote

I've been using "EverNote":http://evernote.com/ for some time. It's good piece of software, but for me it lacked some unnamed quality.

I decided to use my own website for this kind of note-taking, with additional benefit of my notes being published on the web, hopefully for the benefit of others as well.

There was a problem of existing EverNote notes so I wrote "this python script":http://github.com/kjk/web-blog/blob/6a5161d2a362f2b4a35688235f9d00445f7f7f23/scripts/evernote-to-file.py to extract the notes and then import them as posts to this site.

It was surprisingly easy: the script is less than 150 lines of python. EverNote team had the good sense of using sqlite for their database storage. A little bit of reverse-engineering of the database file with "SQLite Manager":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5817 revealed that the author liked the letter Z and that the schema is straightforward.

If you plan to use the script beware that it's more a template from which to start your own thing than a complete solution. It only dumps the data I was interested in (note title, creation date, tags and content) in a format that was simple for me to use.

EverNote also has well-documented server API, but using it seemed more complicated than digging things out of sqlite database. And would be many, many times slower.
