In my company we wanted to do code reviews. While code review process is mostly about people, a good tool goes a long way.

My first thought was to use "ReviewBoard":http://www.review-board.org/, but I was dreading installation process. Then I found out that "Rietveld":http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/ can be easily installed as an add-on for Google Apps domain.

The short version is: Rietveld works well. There were few gotchas:

* Rietveld doesn't support configuring with svn+ssh repositories which was important for us since our repository is not public. That means that during configuration I had to use a dummy repository link and that the only way to submit code for review is upload.py script
* I have downloaded the public version of upload.py script. Big mistake: it doesn't work with the version hosted with Google Apps. You have to download the script from your own instance
* upload.py script often fails with 302 HTTP error. When that happens, delete cached authentication: @rm ~/.codereview_upload_cookies@
