It's a good habit to preview your changes before committing them. Long time ago I wrote a program to help with that on Windows, called "scdiff":/software/scdiff/. On mac, if you have TextMate installed, a simple shell script does the job just as well:

<code>
#!/bin/sh

if [ -d ".svn" ]
then
    svn diff | mate
else
    git diff | mate
fi
</code>
