**Password-less authentication:**

-   generate public and private key (e.g. with
    `ssh-keygen -q -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -t rsa`) (or `-t dsa`)
-   on the machine from which you connect: put private key in
    \~/.ssh/id\_rsa (for rss key) or `~/.ssh/id_dsa` (for dsa key), with
    0600 permissions
-   on the machine you connect to: append public key to
    `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` (also with 0600 permission)

**Using a different username with svn+ssh:**

By default ssh uses \$USER when connecting to a server. This makes
things difficult if you use svn with ssh authentication and your
username for svn server is different than \$USER. To get around this
define per host SSH settings. To do this, edit `~/.ssh/config` and add
the lines:

    Host svn.yourserver.com
    User jdoe

That instructs ssh to use the username jdoe instead of your unix
username when connecting to svn.youserver.com. If you use
password-protected ssh keys, you will be prompted for a private key
password, like this:

`Enter passphrase for key '/home/jdoe/.ssh/id_dsa':`

To get around this you can either setup ssh-agent to cache this password
or you can turn off the password on your private key. To do the latter:
`ssh-keygen -t dsa -p` and when it prompts for a new passphrase, just
hit enter.

**Using ssh agent:**

Ssh agent remembers password for your private key, so you only have to
type it once in a session, not every time it’s used.

Start ssh agent: **ssh-agent**\
Add keys: **ssh-add**\
List currently loaded keys: **ssh-add -l**

**Cygwin and ssh agent:**

Add this to `~/.bashrc`:

<code>

\#\# Enable ssh agent\
export SSH\_AUTH\_SOCK=/tmp/.ssh-socket

ssh-add -l \>/dev/null 2\>&1

if [ \$? = 2 ]; then\
 \# Exit status 2 means couldn’t connect to ssh-agent; start one now\
 rm ~~rf /tmp/.ssh~~\*\
 ssh-agent -a \$SSH\_AUTH\_SOCK \>/tmp/.ssh-script\
 . /tmp/.ssh-script\
 echo \$SSH\_AGENT\_PID \>/tmp/.ssh-agent-pid\
fi

function kill-agent {\
 pid=\`cat /tmp/.ssh-agent-pid\`\
 kill \$pid\
}

function addkeys {\
 ssh-add \~/.ssh/id\_dsa\*\
}\
</code>

**Set an alias for a hostname**

In `~/.ssh/config`:

    Host dev30
    HostName dev30.kowalczyk.info
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa_opendns
