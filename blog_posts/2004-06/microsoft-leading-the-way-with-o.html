Title: Microsoft leading the way with open bug database

<p>I have to say that Microsoft often surprises me. Last time it was explosion of bloggers among Microsoft employees. Today it's <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/">product feedback center</a> where people can submit bugs and suggestions on developer tools. As far as I can tell this is the first such initiative from such a big company for a non-open source product.</p>

<p>It's interesting not only because Microsoft is brave enough to host a website that lists only bad things about their software (imagine what ammunition it'll be for a ms-haters, ultimate proof that ms software is full of bugs).</p>

<p>Looking through comments on those bugs, Microsoft is really reading bug reports, tries to repro them and fix them.</p>

<p>I haven't seen such openess in a software company of this size. Where's similar commitment from IBM, Borland, Adobe, Apple, Macromedia?</p>

<p>Just in case anyone was wondering, this is an example of one of those little things that Microsoft does that made them the biggest software company.</p>
