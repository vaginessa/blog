I have Windows 7 installed on my MacBook under VirtualBox. To keep things simple, I keep my code on mac side, sharing the directory with Windows side.

Tip #1: VirtualBox 2.2.4 has weak implementation of shared folders. For example, Visual Studio 2008 sees the files on shared drive as write-protected (even though other applications don't). Visual Studio 2010 doesn't have this problem, but it can't finish compilation, complaining it cannot write some intermediary build files to a shared folder. Also, trying to mark shared folder as trustworthy for .NET doesn't seem to work (see below).

Solution: use Mac's built-in file sharing instead and shared things out using built-in samba (smb) sharing in System Preferences/Sharing.

Another problem is that .NET by default doesn't trust code on network drives and Visual Studio will tell you that "The Project Location is Not Trusted" if you open a project from a network drive. The magic incantation to make a given shared folder (in my case it's drive z:) trusted is:

<code>
caspol -q -machine -addgroup 1.2 -url file://z:/* FullTrust
</code>

This command has to be executed as Administrator.

One way to have @caspol.exe@ available in the %PATH% is to start Visual Studio cmd-line (shortcut is installed in Start menu).
