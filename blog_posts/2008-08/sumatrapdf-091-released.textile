--------------
A smaller update to my PDF viewer for Windows. The biggest improvement is in handling more PDFs correctly (e.g. those generated with Crystal Reports)

Other changes:

* improved rendering of some PDFs
* support for links inside PDF file
* added -restrict and -title cmd-line options (contributed by Matthew Wilcoxson)
* enabled SyncTex support which mistakenly disabled in 0.9
* misc fixes and translation updates
