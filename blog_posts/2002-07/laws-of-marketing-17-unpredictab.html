--------------
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667">The
book</a> says: unless you write your competitors' plans, you can't predict the 
future. You don't know the future, you don't know what your competition will do so 
you have to build your company and marketing strategies to be flexible, to be able 
to quickly respond to changing situation.
