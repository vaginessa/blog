<p>One of the principles of good design is discoverability: it should be easy for users to discover what the program can do just by fooling around.</p>

<p>Menus and toolbars add discoverability: they don't interfere if users don't care about them but they're always there, visible, for users to&nbsp;try out&nbsp;new features of the program.</p>

<p>Emacs, in general, has poor discoverability. Most of the work is being done with arbitrary keystrokes and obscure lisp functions and the only way to find out what a given keystroke does is by reading copious manuals or using one of the obscure lisp functions to list current key bindings. <br />This is efficient for experienced users but presents a very high barrier to entry for new users.</p>

<p>There are two problems:<UL><LI>it's hard to find out what a given keystroke does <LI>it's hard to find out what is a keystroke that does what I want </LI></UL></p>

<p>It would help discoverability if users could easily find those 2 things out. Here enters my idea: we need to add a new window that will list all keystrokes that are reachable from a given point.</p>

<p>Normally it would be empty. When users presses "Alt" key it would list all keystrokes that start with "Alt" key. Entries should be sorted in the order of usefulness.</p>

<p>That way users could see what a given keystroke does and with time learn other useful keystroke by looking at the list of available options.</p>

<p>This window could be small, permanent window (with the ability to hide/show it) or something that only pops-up when needed (similar to how the auto-completion usually works). This idea is not limited to Emacs - many programs implement key bindings as a short-cut for frequently used functions and could benefit from a system like this.</p>
