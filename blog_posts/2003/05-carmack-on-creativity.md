This John Carmack's quote is worth remembering:\

> *"Putting creativity on a pedestal can also be an excuse for
> laziness.\
>  There is a lot of cultural belief that creativity comes from
> inspiration, and\
>  can't be rushed. Not true. Inspiration is just your subconscious
> putting things\
>  together, and that can be made into an active process with a little
> introspection.\
>  Focused, hard work is the real key to success. Keep your eyes on the
> goal, and\
>  just keep taking the next step towards completing it. If you aren't
> sure which\
>  way to do something, do it both ways and see which works better."* -
> John Carmack
