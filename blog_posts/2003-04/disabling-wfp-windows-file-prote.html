--------------
New versions of Windows have a feature of automatically re-installing files if they have been deleted/modified. It's a way to protect vital system files from accidental deletion or being modified by a virus. Usually it is a good thing but sometimes it prevents you from doing something useful e.g. replacing notepad.exe with something better. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb%3Ben-us%3B222473">This article</a> describes how to disable WFP.
