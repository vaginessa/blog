--------------
For complex goals:

* 3 actions that will take you closer to your goals
* 1 action that will take you closer today
* 1 action that can be done daily
* 1 major obstacle and how it can be overcome
* 1 way to improve skills in that area

Students given periodic deadlines do better than students with no deadlines.
