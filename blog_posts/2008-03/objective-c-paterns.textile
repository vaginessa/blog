--------------
MVC:

* model is the data. gives the data to view. view reads the data. controller changes data
* view is the display. reads data from model. reports user interaction to controller
* controller. changes the data based on user interaction in the view

Target/Action (command):

* in cocoa, this is how responding to actions from controls is implemented
* e.g. when button is pressed, framework sends a message to application code
* general way in which object (e.g. button) can send messages to undetermined object (part of application code you write)
* IB (Interface Builder) does that when you create new control, class and instance and ctrl-drag defines target action

Delegation:

* messages send to Holder object are forwarded to Delegate
* Holder needs an instance of Delegate and a way to set it

Chain of responsibility:

* a message is handled by the most appropriate object out of many
* used in cocoa for handling events. An event message is sent to a first responder object (e.g. if clicked on a button, button objects is the first responder). If the object doesn't know how to handle the message, it sends it to the next object in chain etc.
