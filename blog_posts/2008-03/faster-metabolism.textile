For faster metabolism:

* vitamin B (spinach, asparagus, beans (navy, soy, black beans), melon, broccoli, fish, poultry, eggs
* magnesium (green vegetables like spinach), halibut, nuts (almonds, cashews, peanuts), soybeans, whole-grain cereals, oatmeal, black-eyed peas and lentils.
* snack with healthy carbs and proteins (peanut butter and banana, trail mix, hummus and baby carrots, apple with low-fat cheddar cheese). protein + carb regulates blood sugar, energy levels and feelings of satiety
* eat breakfast (increases resting metabolism by 10%). whole-grain cereal and fruit, whole-wheat toast and peanut butter or fat-free yogurt with granola
* interval training - short bouts of intense activity with lower intensity activity (e.g. alternate sprint and jog)
* strength training
