Design process at Apple (from http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/03/apples_design_p.html):

* pixel-perfect prototypes
* build 10 different mockups for every feature, then 3 out of those ten for more work, then settle on 1

It's better to try out many ideas than overthink less ideas. winners do more experiments faster
