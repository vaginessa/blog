[ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) is a nifty improvement over grep
written in perl. However, it’s a command-line app and those days dumping
results into terminal window isn’t very inspired.

What would be nice is a Visual Ack, which would present the results in
an easier to digest way i.e. an app with native UI with results in a new
window, nicely presented.

That’s my lazy web request for today.
