Google's Chris DiBona sent me this e-mail, which I post verbatim:

An occuring theme in bloggers vs. journalists wars is lack of\
profesionallism on the part of bloggers. I'm going to do my part in\
raising the bar among bloggers by doing some fact-checking.

I can't fact-check Google's contribution to Linux kernel, because, as\
I understand it, 4 people involved prefer to remain anonymous.

[Greg Stein](http://www.lyra.org/greg/) is indeed an established open
source persona, ex-Microsoft and ex-collabnet\
employee, now working at Google. Judging by [mailing list
postings](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-cvs&w=2&r=1&s=gstein&q=a)
for 2004, he is still actively\
involved in Apache project, both in his role as the Chair of Apache\
Foundation and ocasionally as a developer.

Regarding Python, In my research I only found a reference to the fact\
that Greg [\
wrote httplib](http://www.livejournal.com/users/bramcohen/6531.html),
which ships with Python. A scan of [python-dev mailing\
list archives](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/) did not
show up posts by him in 2004 (I admit that\
the methodology used, i.e. eyeballing, isn't too reliable). So I'll\
assume that those days he's not an active contributor to Python.

Regarding Subversion, Greg's past contribution there are undeniable\
(he was one of the architects and core developers) but I wouldn't call\
him an active contributor during his Google days. [No
posts](http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/SearchList?list=dev&searchText=Greg+Stain&defaultField=sender&Search=Search)
to Subversion dev\
list in 2004, [around 30
posts](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?a=103578887800012&r=1&w=2)\
to subversion-issues and subversion-cvs lists. Generously, that's about\
few days of work.

Greg started at Google [around April
2004](http://www.python.org/~jeremy/weblog/040416a.html) (shortly after,
in May 2004, he applied [this
patch](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-cvs&m=108992005825497&w=2)
adding Apache mime type mapping for Google-endorsed Atom syndication\
format. I don't really know [why I mentioned
that](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=20440#c6)).

Starting date has relevance here since I'm looking for contributions\
while being employed by Google, not before or after.

I'm not sure if the reference to Apache project is only referring to
Greg or to more people. Not knowing their names, I can't fact check it.

So that's 6 people so far, 4 anonymous Linux kernel developers, Greg and
Jeremy\
Hylton (a core Python developer).

In case you were wondering, Google has [1,900+
employees](http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/facts.html).\
Google's market capitalization is [52.71
billion](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOG&d=t) (compared to Microsoft's
290.49 billion, yhoo's 51.80 billion and Red Hat's 2.45 billion).

Last quarter earnings [were \$805
million](http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2004/10/22/googles_earnings_more_than_double/),
\$52 million of it being a profit.\
The profit would be \$125 million if it wasn't for a patent dispute\
with Yahoo. From which we can learn that software patents are a good
way\
to transfers large chunks of money from one company to another, with\
hefty provision for lawyers and partially supported by me and you\
(tax money used to pay for courts, judges salaries etc.) although I\
don't quite get what is benefit for me from that. Will Yahoo! service\
will be any cheaper because they won patent war with Google? If yes,\
doesn't that mean that Google's service will more expensive? What do I,\
as a consumer, gain from this battle over patents?

I gathered most of this information using Google's free search engine.\
Market data retrieved thanks to free Yahoo! finance. I was able to\
stay up till 5 A.M. thanks to tea which is not free but of negligible\
cost.

And all of that has nothing to do with me being bitter about Google\
not hiring me. Word.
