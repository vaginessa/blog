A good book grips you and forces you  to keep reading until you're done.
Steve Wozniak's "[iWoz](http://www.iwoz.org/book)" and Jessica
Livingston's "[Founders at work](http://www.foundersatwork.com/)" are
such books.\
\
Wozniak's book is inspirational for an engineer and shows how passion
and hard work leads to creating great products and making lots of
money.\

Livingston's book is inspirational for an entrepreneur and shows how
passion and hard work (sometimes) leads to creating great products and
making lots of money.\
\
The book I was disappointed by is Scott Rosenberg's "[Dreaming in
code](http://www.dreamingincode.com/)". I bought it because it promised
to describe the behind-the-scenes story of
[Chandler](http://chandler.osafoundation.org/), a project I was
interested in. And the parts that did that - I liked. However, it also
had large sections on tangential issues about the business of creating
software that might be interesting to some but weren't to me (mostly
because I already knew about all that other stuff).\
