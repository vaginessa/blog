--------------
This release comes a little sooner that I planned but I wanted to fix
rendering issues that cropped in version 0.4 when I switched the default
rendering engine from poppler to mupdf. I fixed all the issues reported
on the forums and in the bug tracker.\
\
But I didn't stop there. I've also made some bugfixes and speedups so
the application should feel more snappy and you should see "please wait"
message less often plus I re-enabled predictive rendering of the next
page (which got lost in version 0.4), for even better and faster reading
experience.\
\
Caching has been improved so SumatraPDF shouldn't consume as much memory
as it used to in long reading sessions.\
\
I've added keyboard shortcuts for rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise
(Ctrl-Shift-+ and Ctrl-Shift--, just like Acrobat Reader). This was
suggested recently on the forums.\
\
And finally I added an About menu.\
\
Enjoy!\
