Releasing a first version of a new program is a first step in a hopefully
long journey.

We've released [dbHero](https://dbheroapp.com), a GUI database client for Mac
and Windows. It currently supports PostgreSQL.

Here's how it looks like:

The version is 0.1.9, which should hint that this is an early version.

It works, it's useful but there's so much more we plan to do.

We're following a rule that [if you're not embarrased when you ship your
first version you waited too long](http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/).

Give it a try and [let us know](https://dbheroapp.com/feedback) how
we can improve it.
