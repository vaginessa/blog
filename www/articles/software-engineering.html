    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>This essay is a summary of points made by David Parmenter during
    a <a href="http://www.aduni.org/colloquia/parmenter/">talk</a> given at ArsDigita University.
    The university lost its funding and no longer exists but wonderful lectures and colloquia are
    still on-line. I've you're learning Computer Sciences, I highly recommend to watch them.
    You can watch them on-line (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj_06ZDN6vY">part 1</a>,
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44iUKKtBuw8">part 2</a>) or
    <a href="http://www.aduni.org/colloquia/parmenter/">download</a> for offline viewing.</p>

    <h3>Summary of what does David says</h3>

    <p>Software is complex and hard. The big issue is trying to get the complexity under control.
    "Code like hell" is not a good way to do it. No process is necessarily better than other, but a
    process is much better than no process. Extreme Programming: especially the testing perspective
    (develop tests first).</p>

    <p>Talk to the costumer, even if you're just a programmer. Be costumer focused.</p>

    <p>Ask questions, you might learn something. Network with your peers. Don't work for or with
    bozos. Interview is a both-way: they evaluate you, you evaluate them.</p>

    <p>Make use out of down-time. Don't play solitaire, go grab the source code you haven't seen
    and start reading it. Learn new stuff. Read open-source stuff.</p>

    <p>Build the debugging into the system - otherwise it'll be hell to figure out why it doesn't
    work. Instrument the code. Use the google to find for solutions to problems (compiler warnings
    etc.)</p>

    <p>Keep it simple and work in small chunks.</p>

    <p>Get into the habit of writing programs from scratch.</p>

    <p>Don't put things off. When asked to do something, just do it.</p>

    <p>Read the manual (for tools, for library functions).</p>

    <p>Be grateful to people finding bugs in your software (i.e., don't let your hurt ego
    interfere).</p>

    <p>Don't program by experimentation.</p>

    <p>Automate the workflow (always when you repeat the same keystrokes). You can use Python,
    Ruby, Perl, Lisp.</p>

    <p>Use regexps to grep through the source in Emacs. (<i>I would add: use <a href=
    "http://www.sourceinsight.com">SourceInsight instead</a>, much more powerful (especially for
    C/C++ code).</i></p>

    <p>Refactor the code - take the code apart and put it together again. It's scary to refactor -
    fear that change will break the stuff. Another reason to have automated tests.</p>

    <p>Learn the tools - they are productivity gains.</p>

    <p>Use version control. Use bug database (defect tracking).</p>

    <p>Quality analyzer (purify) and code coverage tools. Profilers. Expensive.</p>

    <p>Learn to estimate. Be pessimistic. Make trade-offs, prioritize.</p>

    <p>Business people matter. Business stuff matters. Technology is secondary.</p>

    <p>Installation script for your software is important - this is the first thing
       that a custmore sees. Make it good.</p>

    <p>Don't work with primadonnas.</p>
